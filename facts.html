								<h3>Production records</h3>
								<p>Today, Brazil produces about third of the world's supply, according to the International Coffee Organization, about twice as much as the second place holder, Vietnam.</p>
								<p>Kona coffee is the United States' gift to the coffee world. Because coffee traditionally grows best in climates along the equator, Hawaii's weather is optimal for harvesting beans. California also recently got into the coffee game with dozens of farms now churning out pricey premium bags.</p>

							    <h3>Consumption records</h3>
								<p>You’d think that spending an average of $1092 on coffee each year would be enough to make America the world’s most caffeinated nation. You would be wrong.</p>
								<p>Though Finland does not produce any beans of its own, its citizens drink a lot of the brown stuff—the most of any country in the world.</p>

								<h3>Coffee ban!</h3>
								<p>Back in 1511, leaders in Mecca believed it stimulated radical thinking and outlawed the drink. Some 16th-century Italian clergymen also tried to ban coffee because they believed it to be "satanic." However, Pope Clement VII loved coffee so much that he lifted the ban and had coffee baptized in 1600. </p>
								<p>Even as recently as the 18th century, the Swedish government made both coffee and coffee paraphernalia (including cups and dishes) illegal for its supposed ties to rebellious sentiment.</p>

								<h3>Coffee was discovered by a goat herder</h3>
								<p>Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating the fruit of the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee was born.</p>

							    <h3>Drinking coffee could extend your cat's life</h3>
								<p>Maybe it’s a coincidence, but the Guinness World Record holder for “Oldest Cat Ever”—a 38-year-old kitty named Creme Puff—drank coffee every morning of her furry little life (plus enjoying bacon, eggs, and broccoli). Before you dismiss that outright, consider this: The cat that Creme Puff beat out for the record (a 34-year-old cat, appropriately named Grandpa Rex Allen) had the same owner, and was fed the exact same diet.</p>

								<h3>The most expensive coffee is made by cat poop</h3>
								<p>“Kopi Luwak” is the most expensive coffee in the world.  It comes from Indonesia and is made from beans digested from the Asian Palm Civet. In other words, it comes from cat poop.  It sells for €350 and up per kilo!</p>
